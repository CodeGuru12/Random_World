- Make color below trees more realistic grass color
- Allow sprite to jump
- Figure out better way to change screens that doesn't rely on assigning numbers
- Fix walk animation to be default standing when not moving
- Collision detection with objects
- Smarter bliting, only want to re-blit the things that the player sprite has walked over
- Better map management, list three layers deep will get wildly unmanagemable pretty quickly
