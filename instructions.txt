Instructions

1.) Install python if you don't have it already. (I think I have 3.9.1)
2.) Add python to your environment variable PATH if you haven't already to run it from the command line
    Mine is here:
	 C:\Users\thoma\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\
	 C:\Users\thoma\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts\

3.) Open up a command window and type python, press enter. If it starts the python interpreter everything is golden
    and it's on your path

4.) Now run this command 'pip install pygame'. That will install the pygame library you need to run my code.


5.) If that installs successfully (which it should, and it takes 5 seconds) you should just need to download 
    my code from my repo which is here: 
 	https://github.com/CodeGuru12/Random_World

6.) Click on the little green button that says code, and click download zip. No need to try to clone the git repo unless 
    you want to.

7.) Now that you have the .zip folder, just unzip it in your downloadds folder, and open a cmd window there (shift-right-click)
 
8.) Go into Random_World-main folder, you'll see a few folders and common_utilities.py, and main.py

9.) From the cmd window you just opened run 'python main.py' 

10.) That'll launch the code, and you can run around the 3x3 map with a sprite dude. Nothing to do yet of course  
     except run into the walls at the edges of the map
